## Project Overview

The Counter App is a straightforward web application that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of the key components and features:

- **HTML Structure**: The project uses an HTML document to create the user interface. It defines a counter and two buttons (increment and decrement) within a flexbox container.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is included to style the user interface elements. It provides responsive design and various utility classes for styling.

- **Font Awesome Icons**: The project includes Font Awesome icons to enhance the user interface. Icons are used for the increment and decrement buttons to make the app more visually appealing.

- **JavaScript Functions**: JavaScript is used to handle the logic of incrementing and decrementing the counter. Two functions, `increment()` and `decrement()`, are defined to modify the counter value displayed on the screen.

## Usage

Once you have the Counter App open in your web browser, you can use it as follows:
